# Hackathon IT-TEAM Setup Guide!
let's set up the necessary tools and configurations for the project:

### âœ… Step 1: Install Python
Follow the official **[Python installation guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** for your operating system:  
> We will use the latest version which is currently `3.13.2`.

- **Windows**: Download & install Python, then make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.  
- **Mac/Linux**: Python is likely pre-installed, but update it if necessary (`brew install python3` on Mac).  

Verify installation by running:  
```sh
python --version
```

### âœ… Step 2: Install VS Code (Recommended IDE)
We'll be using Visual Studio Code as our primary editor. Download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install it.

Don't forget to install the Python extension inside VS Code for a better experience!
>NOTE: When developing on VS Code we will use the built in terminal to run the code, you can use powershell but if you prefer Linux make sure to install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 

### âœ… Step 3: Set Up Git & GitHub
We'll use GitHub for  version control and collaboration, so make sure you have:
- Github Desktop installed â†’ Download [here - GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).
- A GitHub account (if you donâ€™t have one yet, create one [here - GitHub SignUp](https://github.com/signup))
- Access to this projectâ€™s repository - Just reach out to me with your Github username and I will grant you permissions.

### âœ… Step 4: Install & Configure Docker
We will use **Docker** to containerize and deliver our application.
>If you're new to Docker, check out the Docker Docs to get familiar with it.

Make sure you have Docker installed and working on your machine:
- Install Docker â†’ Download [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- Verify installation by running:

```
sh
docker --version
```
